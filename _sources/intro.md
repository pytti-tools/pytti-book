# Welcome to PyTTI

## A brief history of

The tools and techniques described here were pioneered in 2021 by a diverse and distributed collection of amazingly talented ML practitioners, researchers, and artists. The short version of this history is that Katherine Crowson ([@RiversHaveWings](https://twitter.com/RiversHaveWings)) published a notebook inspired by work done by [@advadnoun](https://twitter.com/advadnoun). Katherine's notebook spawned a litany of variants, each with their own twist on the technique or adding a feature to someone else's work. Henry Rachootin ([@sportsracer48](https://twitter.com/sportsracer48)) collected several of the most interesting notebooks and stuck the important bits together with bublegum and scotch tape. Thus was born PyTTI, and there was much rejoicing in sportsracer48's patreon, where it was shared in closed beta for several months so sportsracer48 wouldn't get buried under tech support requests (or so he hoped).

PyTTI rapidly gained a reputation as one of the most powerful tools available for generating CLIP-guided images. In late November, @sportsracer48 released the last version in his closed beta: the "pytti 5 beta" notebook. David Marx ([@DigThatData](https://twitter.com/DigThatData)) offered to help tidy up the mess a few weeks later, and sportsracer48 encouraged him to run wild with it. Henry didn't realize he'd been speaking with someone who had recently quit their job and had a lot of time on their hands, and David's contributions snowballed into [PYTTI-Tools](https://github.com/pytti-tools)!

## How is PyTTI-Tools different from PyTTI 5 Beta?

Right now, not very. The main user-visible changes are:

* Local use is now a first-class citizen
* PyTTI is installable and can be run as a CLI tool
* Using PyTTI on the command line gives you magic powers
* PyTTI supports tensorboard, meaning it also integrates with tools like MLFlow and WandB
* Bug fixes and slightly saner code

## Call to action!

My hope is that rather than continuing to fork off messy notebooks with minor changes between them, pytti-tools will become a central hub for organizing and sharing related techniques for this kind of generative art in a way that will enable methods to be shared and combined more fluidly than the 2021 paradigm of doing everything in colab permitted. 

If you're interested in contributing (even if you aren't a coder and just have an idea for something to add to the documentation), please visit our issue tracker: https://github.com/pytti-tools/pytti-core/issues

Please help me untangle this thing before it swallows me whole. Thanks!
